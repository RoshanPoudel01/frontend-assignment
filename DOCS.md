This is a simple react app that shows a list of products from the api and allows searching the products according to the name. Furthermore, it also allows users to limit the number of products they view and also sort the products according to id .
While building the app I have used some react packages such as "react-icons","react-query","react-router","react-router-dom","react-scripts".
I have used Chakra UI in order to create the UI for the application. More on Chakra Ui https://chakra-ui.com/.

To Run the program locally follow the steps:

1. Clone the repo
2. Open the folder where you have cloned and then open terminal inside the folder
3. Install the dependencies (npm install) in terminal
4. Start the app with (npm start) in terminal
